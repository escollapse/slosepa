SLOSEPA

creates an essentially random password by leveraging hash algorithms and cryptographically secure operating system randomness

## usage
./slosepa.py [--length | -l <pw_length>] [--rounds | -r <num_rounds>]

*optional: password length is self-explanatory*


*optional: number of rounds is how many times some random strings will be hashed to generate random nibbles that are mapped to random conversion dictionaries to generate random characters for your ridiculously random password*
